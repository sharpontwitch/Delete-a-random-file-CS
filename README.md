# Delete-a-random-file-CS
Delete a random file in a folder
I edited this from a stackoverflow thread (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54929536/c-sharp-deleting-a-randomly-file/69444649#69444649)
I changed the 1 to a 0 in the deletion portion to remove all files instead of all but one
I made button big because haha, make sure to change directory to delete files from different folders
thats all for now <3
